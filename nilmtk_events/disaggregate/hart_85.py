        When searching the working buffer for pairs, the order in which 
        entries are examined is very important. If an Appliance has 
        on and off several times in succession, there can be many 
        pairings between entries in the buffer. The algorithm must not
        allow an 0N transition to match an OFF which occurred at the end 
        of a different cycle, so that only ON/OFF pairs which truly belong 
        together are paired up. Otherwise the energy consumption of the 
        appliance will be greatly overestimated. The most straightforward 
        search procedures can make errors of this nature when faced with 
        types of transition sequences.

        Hart 85, P 32.
        For the two-state load onitor, a pair is defined as two entries
        which meet the following four conditions:
        (1) They are on the same leg, or are both 240 V,
        (2) They are both unmarked, 
        (3) The earlier has a positive real power component, and 
        (4) When added together, they result in a vector in which the 
        absolute value of the real power component is less than 35 
        Watts (or 3.5% of the real power, if the transitions are 
        over 1000 W) and the absolute value of the reactive power 
        component is less than 35 VAR (or 3.5%).

        ... the correct way to search the buffer is to start by checking 
        elements which are close together in the buffer, and gradually 
        increase the distance. First, adjacent  elements are checked for 
        pairs which meet all four requirements above; if any are found 
        they are processed and marked. Then elements two entries apart 
        are checked, then three, and so on, until the first and last 
        element are checked...
